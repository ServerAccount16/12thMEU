  config_ammo.hpp

  This file defines custom ammo classes. Each class inherits from an ArmA 3 base
  or a modded base (e.g., OPTRE_...).

  Key points:
    - `hit`, `indirectHit`, and `indirectHitRange` define damage values.
    - `caliber` influences how armor is penetrated.
    - `airFriction` affects ballistic drop (negative friction slows the projectile).
    - `typicalSpeed` is muzzle velocity in m/s.
    - `timeToLive` for underwater ammo restricts how far it can travel underwater.

  NOTE: The "base class" references indicate from which class we are inheriting
        default properties. Make sure the base class is loaded by `requiredAddons[]`.
